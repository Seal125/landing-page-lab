      <p id="first">This paragraph is all about being a paragraph. I don't really know what else to put here, but this is going to be a paragraph regardless. Being hungry is never fun, but that's why we have the kitchen. When someone says they don't know, they actually do, but they're not sure if they're correct. I'll just add an extra sentence here. And another here, to balance the amount of words in this.</p>
      <p id="second">This is yet another paragraph. I must keep writing stuff to fill the paragraph, but thankfully, there are only two of these. The paragraph is a little longer here, so I do believe that I must come up with yet more things to randomly spew in this paragraph. Whales are pretty cool, but dolphins are cooler. Seals are the coolest of them all though, take my word for it. Salmon has a silent l which will confuse the heck out of everyone that says it and is suddenly corrected, as well as any ESL student or person. What's up with the English language, right? It's weird but it's what many people out of the US want to learn, so it must be pretty important.</p>
